# Flex Main Page
This hosts the code used in the MVP for Flex, our startup where we aimed to use Machine Learning for real-time form correction. The repo was made public because the startup failed to take off due to lack of experience in prospecting the market.
## To use new repo

run this `git config --global alias.clone-all 'clone --recurse-submodules'
git config --global alias.pull-all 'pull --recurse-submodules'`

Then git clone-all https://github.com/Yuheng3107/fitai

Subsequently, you need to git add, commit and push submodules before doing the same for the main repo.
